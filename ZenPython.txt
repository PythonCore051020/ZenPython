In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
